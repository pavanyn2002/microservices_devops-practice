# Architecture Documentation

## System Architecture

The Spring Boot Microservices Sample follows a distributed microservices architecture pattern with the following key components:

## Design Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility
Each microservice has a single, well-defined business responsibility:
- **User Service**: User management and authentication
- **Product Service**: Product catalog and information
- **Inventory Service**: Stock levels and inventory tracking
- **Order Service**: Order processing and fulfillment
- **API Gateway**: Request routing and cross-cutting concerns

### 2. Decentralized Data Management
Each service manages its own database, ensuring data independence and service autonomy.

### 3. API-First Design
All services expose RESTful APIs following OpenAPI standards for consistent communication.

### 4. Stateless Services
Services are designed to be stateless, enabling horizontal scaling and fault tolerance.

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication
- HTTP/REST for real-time operations
- API Gateway routes requests to appropriate services
- Direct service-to-service communication when needed

### Service Discovery
Currently using static configuration. Future enhancements could include:
- Eureka Service Registry
- Consul
- Kubernetes Service Discovery

## Data Management

### Database Per Service
Each microservice has its own H2 database instance:
- Ensures data isolation
- Enables independent scaling
- Supports different data models per service

### Data Consistency
- Eventual consistency model
- Compensating transactions for distributed operations
- Event-driven updates between services

## Security Architecture

### API Gateway Security
- Central authentication point
- Request validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and throttling

### Service-Level Security
- Input validation in each service
- Business rule enforcement
- Data access controls

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless service design enables multiple instances
- Load balancing through API Gateway
- Independent scaling per service based on demand

### Performance Optimization
- Connection pooling
- Caching strategies (future enhancement)
- Asynchronous processing where applicable

## Fault Tolerance

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
Future implementation for handling service failures gracefully.

### Retry Mechanisms
Configurable retry policies for transient failures.

### Graceful Degradation
Services designed to handle partial system failures.

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Checks
Spring Boot Actuator endpoints for service health monitoring.

### Logging
Structured logging with correlation IDs for request tracing.

### Metrics
Application metrics collection for performance monitoring.

## Deployment Architecture

### Containerization
- Docker containers for each service
- Multi-stage builds for optimized images
- Environment-specific configurations

### Orchestration
Ready for container orchestration platforms:
- Docker Compose for local development
- Kubernetes for production deployment
- Docker Swarm as alternative

## Future Enhancements

### Service Mesh
Integration with service mesh technologies like Istio for:
- Advanced traffic management
- Security policies
- Observability

### Event-Driven Architecture
Implementation of event streaming with:
- Apache Kafka
- RabbitMQ
- Cloud-native messaging services

### API Versioning
Strategies for backward-compatible API evolution.

### Distributed Tracing
Implementation of distributed tracing with:
- Jaeger
- Zipkin
- OpenTelemetry
