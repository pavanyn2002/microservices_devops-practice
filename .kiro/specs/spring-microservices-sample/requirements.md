# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a sample microservices-based application using Spring Boot with 4-5 independent services. The architecture will be simple but realistic, designed specifically for DevOps practice scenarios. Each service will be a standalone Spring Boot project with minimal dependencies, using REST APIs for inter-service communication and H2 in-memory databases for data persistence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer learning microservices architecture, I want a User Service that manages user accounts, so that I can understand how to implement CRUD operations in a microservice context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the User Service is started THEN the system SHALL expose REST endpoints for user CRUD operations
2. WHEN a POST request is made to create a user THEN the system SHALL validate user data and store it in H2 database
3. WHEN a GET request is made for a specific user THEN the system SHALL return user details or appropriate error response
4. WHEN a PUT request is made to update a user THEN the system SHALL update existing user data
5. WHEN a DELETE request is made for a user THEN the system SHALL remove the user from the database

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer practicing microservices, I want a Product Service that manages products, so that I can learn how to handle product catalog functionality in a distributed system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Product Service is started THEN the system SHALL expose REST endpoints for product management
2. WHEN a POST request is made to create a product THEN the system SHALL validate product data and store it
3. WHEN a GET request is made for products THEN the system SHALL return a list of available products
4. WHEN a GET request is made for a specific product THEN the system SHALL return product details
5. WHEN product data is updated or deleted THEN the system SHALL persist changes to H2 database

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer understanding service orchestration, I want an Order Service that handles order creation and links users to products, so that I can learn how services communicate with each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Order Service is started THEN the system SHALL expose REST endpoints for order management
2. WHEN an order is created THEN the system SHALL validate that the user exists by calling User Service
3. WHEN an order is created THEN the system SHALL validate that products exist by calling Product Service
4. WHEN an order is successfully created THEN the system SHALL store order details linking user ID to product IDs
5. WHEN orders are retrieved THEN the system SHALL return order information with user and product references

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer learning inventory management, I want an Inventory Service that manages stock for products, so that I can understand how to handle inventory tracking in microservices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Inventory Service is started THEN the system SHALL expose REST endpoints for inventory management
2. WHEN inventory is checked for a product THEN the system SHALL return current stock levels
3. WHEN inventory is updated THEN the system SHALL modify stock quantities and persist changes
4. WHEN stock levels are queried THEN the system SHALL provide accurate inventory information
5. WHEN inventory operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer learning API gateway patterns, I want an optional API Gateway Service, so that I can understand how to route requests to different microservices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API Gateway is started THEN the system SHALL provide a single entry point for client requests
2. WHEN requests are made to the gateway THEN the system SHALL route them to appropriate backend services
3. WHEN using Spring Cloud Gateway THEN the system SHALL configure routing rules for each service
4. WHEN services are unavailable THEN the gateway SHALL handle errors gracefully
5. IF a simple gateway controller is used THEN the system SHALL provide basic request forwarding functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the project, I want each service to be a standalone Spring Boot project with its own pom.xml, so that I can understand service independence and deployment isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each service is created THEN the system SHALL have its own directory with independent pom.xml
2. WHEN dependencies are defined THEN each service SHALL include only minimal required dependencies
3. WHEN services are built THEN each SHALL compile and run independently without external dependencies
4. WHEN services are packaged THEN each SHALL produce its own executable JAR file
5. WHEN examining project structure THEN each service SHALL be clearly separated and self-contained

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer learning service communication, I want REST APIs for communication between services, so that I can understand how microservices interact over HTTP.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services need to communicate THEN the system SHALL use REST API calls over HTTP
2. WHEN Order Service needs user data THEN it SHALL make REST calls to User Service endpoints
3. WHEN Order Service needs product data THEN it SHALL make REST calls to Product Service endpoints
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL handle success and error responses appropriately
5. WHEN services are running THEN they SHALL be able to discover and communicate with each other

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer wanting quick setup, I want each service to use H2 in-memory database, so that I can run the application without external database dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each service starts THEN it SHALL initialize its own H2 in-memory database
2. WHEN data is stored THEN it SHALL persist within the service's database instance during runtime
3. WHEN services are restarted THEN databases SHALL be recreated with fresh state
4. WHEN examining configuration THEN H2 database setup SHALL be clearly configured in each service
5. WHEN services run THEN they SHALL not require external database installation or setup

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the project, I want a basic README explaining how to run each service individually, so that I can quickly understand the setup and execution process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is delivered THEN it SHALL include a comprehensive README file
2. WHEN reading the README THEN it SHALL explain how to run each service individually
3. WHEN following README instructions THEN each service SHALL start successfully
4. WHEN services are running THEN the README SHALL explain how to test the endpoints
5. WHEN examining the documentation THEN it SHALL include prerequisites and setup instructions

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer focusing on application code, I want the project to exclude DevOps code, so that I can add Docker, CI/CD, and Kubernetes configurations separately later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is delivered THEN it SHALL not include any Dockerfiles
2. WHEN examining the codebase THEN it SHALL not contain CI/CD pipeline configurations
3. WHEN reviewing project structure THEN it SHALL not include Kubernetes manifests
4. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL be runnable without containerization
5. WHEN services are deployed THEN they SHALL run directly as Spring Boot applications without orchestration dependencies
